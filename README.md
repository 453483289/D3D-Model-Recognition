Model Recognition / Model Rec
=============================

These values are used to create game hacks by modifying the video driver of the target video game. 

For Windows games, this is usually done by modifying DirectX, which is loaded by the game through a DLL.

DirectX generally provides several different interfaces to the game, which are used for rendering. 

Model Recognition is generally used to create wallhack, which allows players to become visible through walls. 

The DirectX function known as DrawIndexedPrimitive (DIP) can be used with Model Recognition to produce a wallhack effect. 

The values in the header files found in the header files for these games equate to the values passed to the DIP function at run-time.
